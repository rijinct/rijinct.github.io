title: Innovation through Data-Driven Diagnostics

Over the last few months, I have been working with Western Australia Research data in deriving analytical insights from a wide range of Data-Silos with unstructured data. It was surprising to see the number of insights that could derive from the variety of data available. The only solution to such an adverse data pattern was to use a complete NoSql model and make the most of an ELT instead of ETL. I have been evaluating the performance and Data modelling capabilities of SnowFlake, DataBricks, Talend, GoogleBigQuery against MarkLogic NoSQL and was amazed by the power of MarkLogic DB, especially from the Security and Data-Modelling point of view. I have been benchmarking performance KPI's for Rest search requests on MarkLogic with more than 100 million documents. I will be sharing the results soon. 

The below 2020 survey shows  Research organizations/Institutes driven with data solutions:

Leaders—those 15% who describe their organization as adept at leveraging data from diverse sources—are not immune from these inhibitors, but change-driving leadership, higher levels of funding, and advantageous relationships are helping them to navigate the process.

## Can Data-Driven approach improve outcomes in Health Care? 

Being data-driven includes looking at various patterns to train a model. Understanding the pattern plays another crucial role. Data Quality monitoring, Data-healing and reloading is other dimension. With all this in place, it is impressive to see the value added to enabling a data-driven diagnostic solution.
